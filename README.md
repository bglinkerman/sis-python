# Dependencies

The client will work using the standard library only, however, if the bellow packages are installed, it will automatically attempt to use them in order to siginificantly improve it's performance:
- requests (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/)
- ujson (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ujson)

# Installation

```
sudo python ./setup.py install
```

# Usage

Import the module
```
import sispy
```

Create a SIS client
```python
# my_token is an optional auth token from SIS
client = sispy.Client(url='https://sis.myorg.com', auth_token='my_token')
```

Authenticate
```python
client.authenticate('user1', 'secret')
```

Fetch all entities of a schema
```python
from pprint import pprint

response = client.entities('test_schema').fetch_all()

for item in response:
    pprint(item)
```

Search for entities of a schema
```python
response = client.entities('test_schema').fetch_all(
    query = {
        'q': { 'some_field': 'some_value' },
    }
)
```

Create a schema
```python
content = {
    'name': 'test_schema',

    '_sis': {    
        'owner': 'ops',
    },
    
    'definition': {
        'hostname': 'String',
        'ip_address': 'String'
    }
}

response = client.schemas.create(content)
```

Update a schema
```python
content_updated = {
    'name': 'test_schema',

    '_sis': {
        'owner': 'ops',
    },

    'definition': {
        'serial_number': 'String',
        'hostname': 'String',
        'ip_address': 'String',
        'status': 'String'
    }
}

schema_entry = client.schemas.update('test_schema', content_updated)
```

Search for schemas
```python
response = client.schemas.fetch_all(
    query = {
        'q': { '_sis.owner': 'ops' },
    }
)
```

Fetch all entities belonging to a schema
```python
response = client.entities('test_schema').fetch_all()
```

Get a schema
```python
response = client.schemas.get('test_schema')
```

Delete a schema
```python
response = client.schemas.delete('test_schema')
```

# API

**sispy.Client(url, version=1.1, auth_token=None)**

* `url` should contain url of the SIS API server
* `version` API version
* `auth_token` is an optional field that is sent in the `x-auth-token` header

## Client authentication

The client may also acquire and use a temporary token to use against the SIS endpoint via the `authenticate` method:
```python
# this method will raise an exception if authentication fails
client.authenticate(user_name, password)
```
On success `client.auth_token` is set to the temporary token acquired.

## Responses

All methods return `sispy.Response()` object that can be iterated over (using `for in`) or accessed similar to a dict or a list (depending on the method used).

List-like response
```python
response = client.entities('test_schema').fetch_all()

# iterate over items in the list
for item in response:
    print item

# print the first item of the list
print response[0]
```

Dictionary-like response
```python
response = client.schemas.get('test_schema')

# iterate over fields
for field in response:
    print field

# print value of field 'field1'
print response['field1']
```

`Response.to_dict()` and `Response.to_list()` methods are also available, returning a dict() or a list() object representation respectively.

`Response` object consists of the below attributes, it is discouraged to access them directly (as these might change in the future) but use the access techniqies outlined above.

* `sispy.Response._result` contains decoded http body (either a list or a dict) and can be inspected directly
* `sispy.Response._meta` holds meta data associated with the response
* `sispy.Response._meta.headers` a dictionary of HTTP response headers
* `sispy.Response._meta.total_count` is defined and set to the value of `x-total-count` HTTP header converted to int() if it's present   

## Variables & methods

**sispy.Client.schemas**

**sispy.Client.hooks**

**sispy.Client.hiera**

**sispy.Client.entities(schema_name)**

* `schema_name` : name of the schema

**sispy.Client.tokens(user_name)**

* `user_name` : name of the user

Objects referred/returned by the above all interact with the appropriate endpoints and expose the following interface:

**fetch_page([query])**

This maps to a GET `/` request against the appropriate endpoint.

* query is an optional dictionary that constructs the query string. Keys in the object may include:
  * q : a dictionary specifying the filter
  * limit : the number of items to return
  * offset : offset into the number of objects to return

Returns a dict-like Response where the `Response._meta.total_count` is an integer that is the total number of items in the collection.

**fetch_all([query])**

This calls `fetch_page` multiple times to fetch all items and returns a list-like Response.

**get(id)**

This maps to a GET `/id` request against the approprivate endpoint.

* id : a string representing the ID of the object on the server. For schemas, hooks, and hiera, this is the `name`.  For entities, it is the `_id`.

A dict-like Response representing the object is returned on success.

**create(content)**

This maps to a POST `/` request against the appropriate endpoint.

* content : a valid dictionary or a list of dictionaries conforming to the endpoint specification

The created object as a dict-like Response is returned on success.

In case bulk create returns a Response dict-like object in the form of
```
{
    'errors': [<items>],
    'success': [<items>]
}
```

**update(id, content)**

This maps to a PUT '/id' request against the appropriate v1 endpoint.

* id : a string representing the ID of the object on the server. For schemas, hooks, and hiera, this is the `name`.  For entities, it is the `_id`

* content : a valid dictionary or a list of dictionaries conforming to the endpoint specification

The updated dict-like Response representing the object is returned on success.

**delete(id)**

This maps to a DELETE '/id' request against the appropriate v1 endpoint.

* id : a string representing the ID of the object on the server. For schemas, hooks, and hiera, this is the `name`.  For entities, it is the `_id`

A dict-like Response representing the deleted object is returned on success.

**delete_bulk(query)**

* query is a dictionary that constructs the query string.

Returns a Response dict-like object in the form of
```
{
    'errors': [<items>],
    'success': [<items>]
}
```

# Error handling

An instance of `sispy.Error` is raised if an HTTP request returns a status code above and including 400.

`sispy.Error` has the following attributes that can be inspected:

* error: SIS error text
* code : SIS error code
* http_status_code : HTTP status code
* response_dict : dictionary representing response body json

Handling connection errors is outside of the client's scope.
